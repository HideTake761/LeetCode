Python

```python
from typing import List

def minimumBoxes(apple: List[int], capacity: List[int]) -> int:

    sum_apple = sum(apple) # the amount of apples to pack
    capacity = sorted(capacity) # sorting in ascending order
    ans = 0 # counting how many boxes are used

    while sum_apple > 0:
        box = capacity.pop() # removing a largest capacity box from capacity
        sum_apple -= box
        ans += 1

    return ans

if __name__ == "__main__":

    apple = [1,3,2]
    capacity = [4,3,1,5,2]
    # apple = [5,5,5]
    # capacity = [2,4,2,7]

    print(minimumBoxes(apple, capacity))
